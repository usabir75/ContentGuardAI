ContentGuard AI
AI-Powered Academic and Content Integrity Scanner
“Protecting originality with intelligent automation.”
―
Overview
ContentGuard AI is a full-stack automated evaluation system designed to analyze written
 assignments, essays, and blog content using advanced AI capabilities. It solves two major
 problems:
• Teachers and academic institutions struggle to manually analyze assignments for AI writing,
 plagiarism, quality, and originality.
 • Website owners and bloggers hire writers but cannot easily detect AI-generated or plagiarized
 content, which risks SEO penalties and reputation damage.
ContentGuard AI provides an end-to-end automated solution that evaluates documents within
 seconds, far faster and more accurately than manual review.
